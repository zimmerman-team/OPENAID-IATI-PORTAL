#### IATI data Portal for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
--------
This is the Angular.JS User Interface the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The http://www.openaid.nl portal has visualized the open data on official development aid projects and programmes executed by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

This platform extracts the raw IATI data published by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the IATI registry, and presents it in an easy-to-use web interface. It does not alter or interpret the data in any way.

This Angular.JS User Interface makes use of the data-engine [OIPA] (http://www.oipa.nl),  enabling IATI XML compliant data to be parsed and interfaced using the OIPA JSON API.

IATI is a global aid transparency standard and it makes information about aid spending easier to access, re-use and understand the underlying data using a unified open standard. You can find more about the IATA XML standard at: www.iatistandard.org
